          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Born in Owen Sound, Ontario in 1991; I spent the first year of my life toiling on a farm before we packed up and moved to the big city (Toronto) for work.  At the age of 3 I became an assistance Wine Maker to my Dad who I am sure found me very helpful.
                <br/><br/>As time went on I decided to get older, eventually finding myself thriving in the Electromagnetic Engineering Technician course at George Brown College.  
                I picked up how to program PLC's and arduinos and the basics of electric and hydrolic circuits quickly and discovered a passion for technology and coding I was previously unaware of.  As much as I loved that whole course the physics class stood out as uniquely exciting, so after I graduated I went back to high school to improve my grades then enrolled in the University of Toronto, 
                where I earned a Physics Specialist Degree.  <br/><br/> While at university I built on my coding skills by analyzing lab results with Python and VPython scripts, and curiousity drove me to learn R for data science and C and C++
                to better understand the software development process. Labs were also a perfect environment to build testing skills as all hardware and software required troubleshooting and testing solutions before any results could be recorded.
                <br/><br/>After University I attended Brainstation and earned a certificate in Data Analysis and then one in Data Science.  The final project for the Data Analysis course is the Alien powerpoint found in the Data Science room.  I also completed the DataQuest data science learning path and several of the freecodecamp courses to learn front and backend development.  I hope one day to work my way into more specialized roles in Data science or Cyber Security.
                <br/><br/>  I am very grateful to PLATO for taking on a completely inexperienced software tester back in 2022 and giving me room to learn and thrive with my new skill set.  My favourite part of software testing is assuming the perspective of the end user and testing user experience.  This has led to me becoming an Accessibility Testing Subject Matter Expert on an internal course and becoming a full time accessibility tester.              
                <br/><br/>I also play keyboards and designed/manage my band's website <a id="band-link" href="https://thedetweilers.com/" target="_blank">thedetweilers.com</a>
                <br/><br/>Thank you for reading!</p>
